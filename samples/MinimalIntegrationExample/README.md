# SwrveSDK Minimal Integration Example

A simple demo app ilustrating usage of the SDK bundle without any compilation steps. Only thing needed is to include the SDK bundle in the html.

## How to run

Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install required dependecies.

Then start a web server at the root of the `MinimalIntegrationExample` and navigate to `index.html`.

Or you can run the built in http server with `yarn start` or `npm start`.
